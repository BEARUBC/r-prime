## Prelude
This framework is still in development.
A version has not been released yet.
Therefore, there is no corresponding crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io) nor any corresponding page for documentation.
As this framework matures, versions will be released to [crates.io](https://crates.io), along with documentation.

## Usage
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
r-prime = { path = "relative/path/to/r-prime" }
```
Once again, since this framework has not been published yet, a local copy will need to be manually installed and linked.
All examples of usage are provided in the `examples` folder.
